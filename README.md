~~K~~Cool Geo Blocker 🌍

KGB is a Go application that manages IP filtering based on country codes using `nftables`. It allows you to configure allowed or denied countries, gather metrics on the number of packets and bytes filtered, and expose metrics for Prometheus monitoring. 📊

## Features ✨

- **Country-based IP Filtering**: Easily allow or block IP addresses from specific countries. 🚫
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Collect and expose metrics about the number of packets and bytes filtered, including the last update time and the status of blocked and allowed countries. 📈
- **Periodic Updates**: Automatically update the filtering rules at specified intervals. ⏲️
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Change the allowed or denied countries at runtime using command-line flags. ⚙️

## Requirements 🛠️

- Go (version 1.16 or newer)
- `nftables` installed on your system
- Prometheus (if you wish to collect metrics)

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kgb.git
   cd kgb
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   go build -o kgb .
   ```

3. (Optional) Make it executable and move it to your PATH:

   ```bash
   chmod +x kgb
   sudo mv kgb /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Usage 🖥️

You can run the application with the following command-line flags:

- `--allow`: Comma-separated list of country codes to allow. ✅
- `--deny`: Comma-separated list of country codes to block. ❌
- `--port`: Port number for the Prometheus metrics endpoint (default is 9000).
- `--timer`: Update interval in minutes (default is 60 minutes).

### Examples 📚

To allow traffic from Russia and Netherlands:

```bash
kgb --allow ru,nl
```

To deny traffic from China and South Korea:

```bash
kgb --deny cn,kr
```
